# ðŸ§  Text Embedding using Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates how to generate sentence embeddings using the [`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model with the Hugging Face Transformers library.  
The output is a fixed-length 384-dimensional vector that captures the semantic meaning of the input text. This is useful for tasks such as text similarity, clustering, and semantic search.
